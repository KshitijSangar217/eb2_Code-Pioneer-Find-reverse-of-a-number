while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true,the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop.
