### Aim
Write C program to reverse a number. 
### Theory
while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true,the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop.It is one of way which gives the learner a deep understanding of While loop and the Arithmetic operators.
### Procedure
1.Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen.<br>
2."START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Reverse_Number" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.<br>
3.Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed.<br>
4.Input box will appear infront of scanf instruction when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button.<br>
5.After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Reverse_Number"<br>
6.After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result is shown in Reverse_Number variable<br>
