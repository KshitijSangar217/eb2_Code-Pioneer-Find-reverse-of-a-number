### Aim
Write C program to reverse a number. 
### Theory
while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true,the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop.It is one of way which gives the learner a deep understanding of While loop and the Arithmetic operators.
### Procedure
1.Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen.<br>
2."START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Reverse_Number" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.<br>
3.Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed.<br>
4.Input box will appear infront of scanf instruction when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button.<br>
5.After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Reverse_Number"<br>
6.After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result is shown in Reverse_Number variable<br>

### Pre Test
1) How many times do while loop will excute if condition is false <br>
<b>a) 1 times<br></b>
b) 2 times<br>
c) infinite<br>
d) finite<br>

2) How many times the initialisation statement in for loop is executed<br>
a) as many times as loop iterates<br>
b) twice<br>
<b>c) once<br></b>
d) None of the above<br>

3) In printf, the format %i is used for? <br>
<b>a) int</b><br>
b) char<br>
c) float<br>
d) None of the above<br>

4) What is the size of int data type?<br>
a) 2 Bytes<br>
b) 4 Bytes<br>
c) 1 Bytes<br>
<b>d) Depends on system/compiler </b><br>

5) Which of the data type does not have a fixed size?<br>
a) int<br>
b) char<br>
<b>c) struct</b><br>
d) None of the above<br>

6) which of the following is valid C statement?<br>
a) char sample var = 'a';<br>
<b>b) char sample_var = 'a';<br></b>
c) char $sample_var= 'a';<br>
d) None of the above<br>
### Post Test
<br>
Q 1. Choose correct C while loop syntax.<br>
a.<pre> while(condition)
{
    //statements
}
<br></pre>
b. 
<pre>{
    //statements
}while(condition)</pre><br>
c. 
<pre>while(condition);
{
    //statements
}</pre><br>
d. 
<b><pre>while()
{
    if(condition)
    {
        //statements
    }
}</pre></b><br>

Q 2.Choose a correct C for loop syntax.<br>
<b>a.<pre>for(initalization; condition; incrementoperation)
{
    //statements
}

<br></b></pre>
b. 
<pre>for(declaration; condition; incrementoperation)
{
    //statements
}
</pre><br>
c. 
<pre>for(declaration; incrementoperation; condition)
{
    //statements
}
</pre><br>
d. 
<pre>for(initalization; condition; incrementoperation;)
{
    //statements
}
</pre><br>

Q 3.What is the output of C Program.? 
<pre>int main()
{
    int a=5;
    
    while(a==5)    
    {
        printf("RABBIT");
        break;
    }
 
    return 0;
}</pre>
<br>
a. RABBIT is printed unlimited number of times<br>
<b>b. RABBIT<br></b>
c. Compiler error<br>
d. None of the above.<br>

Q 4. What is the output of C Program.? 
<pre>int main()
{
    int a=5;
    
    while(a >= 3);
    {
        printf("RABBIT\n");
        break;
    }
    printf("GREEN");
    
    return 0;
}</pre>
<br>
a. GREEN<br>
<b><pre>b.  RABBIT 
 
GREEN</pre>
<br></b>
c. RABBIT is printed infinite times<br>
d. None of the above<br>
